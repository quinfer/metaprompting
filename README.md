To set up an environment for the Streamlit app using conda, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents:

```
anthropic
pandas
streamlit
```

Here's how you can create the environment and install the required packages using conda:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the environment.

3. Create a new file named `requirements.txt` and add the above contents to it.

4. Run the following command to create a new conda environment:
   ```
   conda create --name metaprompt_env python=3.9
   ```
   This will create a new environment named `metaprompt_env` with Python 3.9.

5. Activate the newly created environment:
   ```
   conda activate metaprompt_env
   ```

6. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will install the `anthropic`, `pandas`, and `streamlit` packages in the `metaprompt_env` environment.

7. After the installation is complete, you can run the Streamlit app using the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

By following these steps, you will have a conda environment set up with the necessary packages to run the Streamlit app for metaprompt engineering.

Note: Make sure you have conda installed on your system before proceeding with the above steps. If you don't have conda installed, you can download and install Anaconda or Miniconda from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

## Example
```
You are an AI assistant.  You are passed two variables defining a professional football manager's managerial spells, "club_name" and "start_date".  Your task is to:
1. Search for this spell in your LLM memory bank.
2. Define the spell as either a country or club-level managerial spell. 
3. Provide the country where the "club_name".
4. For club-level spells, provide the Tier the club played in.
5. Provide two probability estimates of the likelihood of your responses to 3 and 4 being genuine.
- If you can answer all 4 questions, provide the answers.
- If you cannot answer 3 or 4, replace with NA.
- If you cannot provide probability estimates, replace with NA.

Only respond in JSON format and avoid any preamble.
Example of response format:
{
  "response": {
    "text": "The main response text generated by the LLM goes here.",
    "variables": {
      "club_name": {
        "name": "club_name",
        "value": "The value of club_name goes here.",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "start_date": {
        "name": "start_date",
        "value": "The value of start_date goes here.",
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "results": {
      "spell_type": {
        "value": "The type of managerial spell (country or club level).",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "country": {
        "value": "The country where the club_name is located, or 'NA' if not available.",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "tier": {
        "value": "The tier the club played in for club-level spells, or 'NA' if not available.",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "country_probability": {
        "value": "The probability estimate of the country response being genuine, or 'NA' if not available.",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "tier_probability": {
        "value": "The probability estimate of the tier response being genuine, or 'NA' if not available.",
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "model": "name_of_the_llm_model",
    "timestamp": "2023-05-14T12:34:56Z",
    "token_count": 150,
    "processing_time": 0.5
  }
